## Compose a new tweet
To use the site, click on the "Write a new tweet" button in the top right corner and a container will appear at the top of the tweet feed. The cursor will automatically focus the area to type the tweet in. Tweets cannot be empty and be 140 characters or less. A counter in the bottom right corner of the new tweet area shows long how the tweet currently is. Once satisfied with the tweet, can press the tweet button and it will be added to the feed of tweets.

When scrolling far enough down the compose tweet button will disappear and a red button in the bottom right corner will appear. This button takes the user back to the top of the page.
